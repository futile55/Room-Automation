## About
We Created a Room Automation system which can control lights, fans, count
no. of persons in the room, show room temperature and a smart door.
• We implemented these features using ESP8266 Node MCU and Arduino UNO.
• These devices were controlled by using a Web-Page and serial communication
with Arduino over any device connected with Wi-Fi provisions.
